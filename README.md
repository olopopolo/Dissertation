# Dissertation
## Annotation procedures
In my dissertation, I have developed an architecture scheme to conduct annotation procedures using EXMARaLDA. Since EXMARaLDA does not allow to create a fixed architecture scheme, I developed a series of tools [exb_tools](https://github.com/olopopolo/exb_tools) that allow to do so.

## Analysis
In my dissertation, I have run different types of analysis on the Leonide data. Analysis range from descriptive statistics to inferential statistics, with different tries to model a constructicon of meanings and constructions into network graph visualizations. The analysis has been run using Python and R.
